# pentest_scripts
Scripts I've put together to help during penetration tests.

- generate_emails.py - takes a list of full names (as generated by TheHarvester or scrape_linkedin.py) and converts them into various common email conventions. Attempts to sanitize the names to a "Firstname Lastname" format.

- scrape_linkedin.py - using a google cse api key, use Google Dorks/Advanced Operators to retreive employee names from GitHub. Sanitize and dump to a list.
